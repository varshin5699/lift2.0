# Lift2.0 - Enhanced Scheduling Algorithm with Object Detection

## Introduction
Lift2.0 is an innovative project that introduces a new scheduling algorithm built on top of the LOOK algorithm for elevators. This project aims to improve elevator efficiency by incorporating computer vision techniques using OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection. The primary focus is to give priority to handicapped individuals, enhancing accessibility and optimizing elevator operations.

## Features
- Scheduling algorithm enhancement using LOOK algorithm
- Object detection using OpenCV and YOLO
- Priority assignment for handicapped individuals
- Integration of asynchronous programming using the Async library
- Implementation in Python for ease of use and extensibility

## Dependencies
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- YOLO
- Async library
